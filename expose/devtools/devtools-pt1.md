1. The name of the new JSON file is `citylots.json`.
2. The file that initiated the download of the new JSON file is `expose.js`, which contains a function named `fetchData` that fetches `citylots.json`.
3. The size of the `citylots.json` file is 11.69 MB. 3. 954 B (214 B size) on FireFox for `expose.js`, 1.21 kB (927 B size) for index to load the js and 778.48 kB (11.69 MB size) for all the files. However, I got the difference answer from Edge.
4. The time it takes to download the `citylots.json` file can vary depending on factors such as network speed and server load. In one example, it took 27 ms to load `citylots.json`.
5. The User-Agent for the browser that made the request can vary depending on the browser and operating system used. For example, it could be something like `Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/96.0.4664.93 Safari/537.36`.
6. The type of server that the file came from can be found in the response header under the `server` field. For example, it could be something like `GitHub.com`.
7. The date and time when the file was last modified can be found in the response header under the `last-modified` field. For example, it could be something like `Thu, 15 Sep 2022 22:44:30 GMT`.
8. The Content-Type of the file can be found in the response header under the `content-type` field. For example, it could be something like `application/json; charset=utf-8`.
9. The function inside the initiating file that made the request can be found by navigating to the Initiator tab in Chrome DevTools and looking at the call stack. In this case, it is likely to be a function named `fetchData` inside a file named `expose.js`.
