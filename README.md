## Description

This lab is an assignment for CSE 110 that introduces me to some fundamental aspects of JavaScript, DevTools, and diagramming. In this lab, I practiced how to use variables, scopes, data types, operators, loops, functions, callbacks, timers, debugging tools, network tab, flowcharts, and more.

The lab has three parts: Expose, Explore, and Expand. In the Expose part, I learned about the basics of JavaScript and how to use Chrome DevTools to debug a faulty program. In the Explore part, I learned about the basics of JavaScript and how to use Chrome DevTools to debug a faulty program. In the Expand part, I learned about the basics of JavaScript and how to use Chrome DevTools to debug a faulty program.

To do this lab, I needed to have Node installed on my computer and a GitHub account. I also needed to install the draw.io extension for VSCode to do the diagramming part. I followed the instructions on the web page context to create the required files and folders for each part of the lab. I also used Chrome DevTools to debug a faulty program and inspect network requests.

This description summarizes what this project is about and what I did. I hope you find it informative and engaging! ðŸ˜Š
