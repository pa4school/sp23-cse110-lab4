1. The bug in the program is caused by the fact that the `num1` and `num2` variables in the `calculateSum` function are strings, not numbers. When using the `+` operator to add two strings together in JavaScript, it concatenates them instead of performing arithmetic addition. As a result, the `result` variable returns a string that concatenates `num1` and `num2` instead of their sum.

2. To fix this bug, you can modify the `calculateSum` function to convert `num1` and `num2` to numbers before adding them together. One way to do this is by using the `Number()` function like so:

```js
function calculateSum(num1, num2) {
  let result = Number(num1) + Number(num2);
  return result;
}
```

After making this change and saving it, we can test it by clicking on the "Calculate" button again to see if it now correctly calculates and displays the sum of the two input numbers.
